# Sessionat Platform

## 1. Introduction
**Sessionat** is a web platform designed for users to explore photographers' portfolios and book photography sessions. Users can view available sessions for each photographer and reserve them for a 24-hour period. During this time, users must complete payments via **Stripe**. If payment is not made within the window, the session will become available for others. Photographers can manage their availability, add sessions, and track bookings and earnings through subscription plans.

## 2. Problem Definition
The current photography booking ecosystem is fragmented, making it challenging for users to find reliable photographers and available sessions. Photographers struggle to manage bookings, payments, and client interactions efficiently. There is a need for a centralized platform to streamline these processes for both users and photographers, improving user experience and maximizing photographer efficiency.

## 3. Proposed Solution
**Sessionat** addresses these challenges by offering:
- A user-friendly interface for browsing photographer portfolios, booking sessions, and making secure payments.
- A dashboard for photographers to manage sessions, track bookings, and monitor earnings.
- A subscription model for photographers to manage their business flexibly.

## 4. Key Objectives
1. Create a seamless booking experience for users.
2. Provide photographers with an efficient system to manage portfolios, bookings, and earnings.
3. Implement a secure payment system using **Stripe**.
4. Enable administrators to manage users, photographers, and access platform data.
